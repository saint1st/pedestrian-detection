# Low-Light Pedestrian Detection (YOLOv8, Leak-Free Split, WBF Ensemble)

Single-class pedestrian detector for **low-light** images (LLVIP subset).  
This repo provides a **scene/near-duplicate safe split**, tuned **YOLOv8s/n** training recipes, **inference parameter sweeps**, and **Weighted Box Fusion (WBF)** ensembling to produce a robust final submission.

> ðŸ’¡ **Why this repo?**  
> Low-light data is prone to label noise, tiny objects, and validation leakage. This template fixes the split first, then squeezes reliable gains with smart inference and ensembling.
